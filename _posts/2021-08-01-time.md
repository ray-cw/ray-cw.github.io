In Nocterna, there is no sun to indicate the passing of time, from day to night. Instead, there is a Time-thread - a dark green line of light that weaves across the sky. While the Light frequently changes colors, the Time-thread is a permanent fixture.

## Months and Years

While there is no sun or moon in the sky, there are stars. During certain periods, certain constellations appear to shine more prominently in the night sky. Each period varies slightly in length (30-34 days) but each of these 13 constellations represents a month. 

These constellations have different names in different cultures. The only standardization is that the titles attributed to each constellation tend to be the same. Here are the names and titles for Calthurion:

1. Beric, the Warrior
2. , the Seer
3. Illya, the Lovers
4. , the Sentinel
5. , the Chained
6. Dezra, the Architect
7. Medea, the Mage
8. Cicero, the Jester
9. Sirius, the Beast
10. Alistair, the King
11. Laurence, the Healer
12. , the Archer
13. Jeddeem, the Stranger

At the end of the Month of the Stranger, the cycle begins anew, marking the start of a new year. A notable pulse of light fires through the Time-thread at the same instance.
