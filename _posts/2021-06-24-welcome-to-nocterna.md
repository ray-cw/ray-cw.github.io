*A farmer awakes in the small village of Dawnmill, due east of the capital. He opens his windows and is greeted by a soft, orange glow, not that of the sun, 
but of the Light: a massive web of dancing lights that cover all the night skies. The orange aurora indicates the warm season continues. Amidst the orange 
are streaks of verdant green, which is a promise of a bountiful harvest. The farmer wastes no time getting to work: what the Light gives, it can just as easily take away.*

*Just several leagues due south of Dawnmill, a hulking figure emerges from a cave. Darkness clings to it, protecting it from the Light.The wavering shadows begin to fade, as the creature takes on a more recognizable form: the shape of a minotaur. In the distance, it sees the small village, brimming with life. It snarls and begins it's advance.*

Welcome to the world of Nocterna, the Darkened Realm, a world without sun. In its place, a brilliant aurora dances across the night sky: ***aurora aeternum*** or colloquially referred to as **"The Light"**. The Light is responsible for the survival of civilization, not just by providing light and warmth, but by repulsing the dark monsters that would tear the land asunder: Shadows, the physical incarnations of mortal Sin itself. 

## The World of Nocterna

The known world of Nocterna is divided into 3 continents: Aegar of the West, Midgar of the Center and Endragar of the East. The Bloodied Waters, a narrow sea, separates Aegar and Midgar. A much larger body of water, The Timeless Ocean, separates Midgar and Endragar. To the west of Aegar lies another body of water, constantly plagued by storms and fog, christened the Desolate Sea.

In Aegar, the northern half of the continent forms the Calthurion Kingdom, a mostly human civilization ruled by House Solaire in alliance with the Church of Light. To the south lies various independent city states and warring factions.

Midgar is the home of the great elven coalition, led by House Trostani of the wood elves. 

Endragar is a chaotic continent, with no single faction claiming rule over the land. It is the home continent of tieflings, halflings and gnomes.

## The Slayers' Guild

> To save the innocent, I descend into Sin.<br>
> To protect their souls, I destroy my own.<br>
> I shall not be cleansed or take rest until the enemy is purged.<br>
> I shall show no mercy, fear or indecision in the face our foe.<br>
> This I swear, upon my twisted heart.<br>
> <div style="text-align: right; font-style: italic;">The Slayer's Oath</div>

To slay a Shadow is no simple feat. Their primary weakness - the Light - could be channeled to destroy them, but it was discovered long ago this had dangerous costs. To channel the Light was to consume it, and the Light required to destroy one Shadow could cast darkness over an entire city. A new organization discovered an alternative method to defeating Shadowkind - by channeling their own strengths against them.

The Slayers' Guild is a mercenary organization that extends past borders. Their solemn mission - to eliminate the world of Shadows altogether. Slayers are trained to draw strength from the remnants of defeated Shadows, dark crystals called 'Shadow Vestiges'. These Vestiges grant them the powerful abilities of their opponents, such as the strength of a Giant, or the ability to fly.

While many factions are happy to have the Slayers' Guild around, a select few find their source of strength 'repulsive'. One major faction, the Church of Light, considers the practice of using Shadow Vestiges completely sacrilegious. As a result, no Slayers outposts or bases can be found inside the Calthurion Empire. That said, Slayers are still permitted to operate as mercenaries within their borders, even if begrudgingly.
