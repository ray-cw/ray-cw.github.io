**Vice's Slayers of Endragar**, or more commonly known as **The Slayers' Guild**, is a paramilitary organization dedicated to the destruction of Shadowkind. Originally founded on the eastern-most continent of Endragar, the Slayers' Guild has since grown to become a global superpower, its only rival being the Church of Light. 

## The Founding of the Slayers' Guild

### Background

Across the world, starting circa 300 EP, civilizations around the world suffered from an increase in the number of Shadow attacks, marking the beginning of a dark century referred to as **'The Great Shadow Blight'**. From the smallest village to the greatest cities, people held their breath as Shadows would stalk the streets right outside their very doorsteps. The Church of Light began providing aid where possible, but they were never a military organization - they simply did not have the strength, numbers or tactics to vanquish the hordes of Shadows.

### Vice, the First Slayer

In 284 EP, on the continent of Endragar, a young tiefling named Vice Griswaine began building a reputation as renowned Shadow hunter. He grew so formidable he drew the ire of Carth, the Wrath Incarnate, member of the Seven Deadly Shadows.

One eve, Carth arrived upon Vice's doorsteps. "Be grateful mortal, that I have deemed you worthy of a glorious death at my own hand," they said. To which Vice laughed and responded, "There is no glory when a god slays an ant. Grant me but a fraction of your power, and let us turn this execution into a duel. Unless you are... afraid?"

Carth gladly accepted the challenge, believing that even a fraction of their own prowess would destroy and corrupt the mortal soul. To his surprise, Vice was able to channel their power, and their duel began in earnest. Their battle lasted a fortnight, until it was interrupted by the arrival, another member of the Seven Deadly Shadows and the Pride Incarnate. "Withdraw Carth," they ordered. To Vice, they said, "Do not be so arrogant to call this your victory, mortal. Sin will destroy you yet."

"Not until you are destroyed with me," responded the First Slayer.

### The Beginning of a New Order

Vice spent decades perfecting the powers given to him by Carth. He discovered that he had the ability to channel the power of slain Shadows, left behind in the form of Shadow Vestiges. He also had access to Carth's unique power - or curse - Berserker's Fury, a combat enhancement that sacrificed control for insurmountable strength. This ability would later be passed down to his successors as head of the Slayers' Guild.

Once he mastered his own abilities, he began training other mercenaries to be able to do the same. It was Clem Sprocket, renowned Gnome inventor and close personal friend of Vice, who analyzed his power and physiology, who invented the Vestige Harness - the technology that now enables all modern Slayers to harness the powers of Shadow Vestiges.

Finally, on was 259 EP, Vice Griswaine and his 20 Slayers officially began their organization, operating out of his hometown of Veldertwin.

## 352 AE - Slayers of Today

Today, the Slayers number in the thousands, with eight Strongholds throughout the world of the Nocterna.

- Veldertwin, located in central Endragar and the capital Stronghold
- Stranger's Hold, located on the eastern coast of Endragar
- Blackhell, the largest Stronghold and located on the southern coast of Endragar
- High Watch, located in northern Endragar
- Musepoint, located on the western coast of Endragar
- New Althier, located in Midgar
- Haleth's Sin, an island off the coast of Midgar. Central base for the Research Division.
- War's End, a port settlement and the newest (and smallest) of the Strongholds. The only Stronghold on Aegar.

Each Stronghold is led by a head Slayer, called a 'Griswaine Slayer'. Griswaine Slayers are granted the same power laid upon Vice Griswaine by the Wrath Incarnate, through a blood ritual spell. Griswaine Slayers hold their title until their death, at which point a new leader must be selected

While officially all Griswaine Slayers are considered equal in rank, and thus there is no one true leader of the Guild, Valor Irestrom, Griswaine Slayer of Veldertwin, is considered the most influential of the eight.

### The Research Division

The Research Division of the Slayers' Guild was officially founded in 218 EP by Haley Sprocket, daughter of Clem Sprocket. While founded years after Clem's death, his extensive research into Shadow physiology and his invention of the Vestige Harness make him widely regarded as the forefather of all Shadow research. 

It is thanks to the Research Division that many initial superstitions and false assumptions about Shadowkind were abolished. They also study the unique relationship/animosity between Shadowkind and the *aurora aeternum*, though not much ground has been made there.

Haleth's Sin, their base of organization, was acquired from the Elven Coalition in the chaotic years following the Exodus. Formerly a POW prison island during the Calthurion-Elven war, it is now in the hands of the Slayers' Guild. Supposedly, very powerful Shadows have been captured and contained on the island for study, though these rumors have yet to be confirmed.

### War's End

> **GM Notes** <br>
> At some point, I will probably make articles for each Stronghold, if it is of any importance to the main campaign. As of now, War's End is the only one you need know about. The only stronghold on Aegar, and the location from which you and your fellow Slayers graduated from.

War's End is the youngest of the Strongholds, founded in 300 AE, just about 50 years prior to the start of the campaign. The port town gains it's name from the Exodus, as a large number of elves were exiled off to Midgar from this coast. 

For 300 years, it has served as a remote military outpost in southern Calthurion. As the costs of maintaining the town began to exceed the benefits of the land (few surrounding natural resources, dangerous proximity to Shadow dens), the town was sold to the Slayers' Guild.

It is currently led by Rufus Twill, a Griswaine Slayer formerly of Blackhell.
