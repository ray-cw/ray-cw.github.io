## Abstract

The dwarves worshiped many gods, the most enigmatic one of their pantheon being Yrindaar, the god of a long forgotten domain. His name has endured millennia, yet the source of his power, his reason for worship, has been a mystery to scholars and mages throughout all known history, earning Yrindaar the title of 'The Forgotten but Remembered God'. Most historians would agree the loss of this information can simply be attributed to the disappearance of dwarven civilization itself. This paper argues that there is another reason for this so-called 'Yrindaar Paradox', with detailed accounts and evidence proving that a supernatural cause is responsible for this loss of knowledge.
