In the year 429 EP (Exodus Prior), an unnamed wizard of the great elven city-state of Althier discovered the *prismatic wall*. When the casting was complete, a great darkness fell over the city, as its denizen looked up in despair - for the Light had vanished without a trace. Within a matter of days, Shadows fell upon the city, slaughtering every man, woman and child

> Each class in DnD draws magic from a different source - clerics and paladins are granted magic by their deities, wizards study the arcane arts intensively and sorcerers just... do, I suppose. In this article we will explore how each class can draw upon magic in this world.

# The Categorization of Magic

There are four primary types of magic in the world:
- Light magic, it's primary source being the *aurora aeternum*
- Dark magic, the magical manifestation of Sin, associated with Shadowkind.
- Creation magic, the fundamental energy of the universe.
- Chaos magic, a broad category encompassing magic drawn from the multiverse.

## Light Magic and Flora Lumino

The Light, as it appears in the sky, is only the physical manifestation of *aurora aeternum*. In truth, the Light envelops the world, even when it is not perceived, very similar to the 'Weave' of the Forgotten Realms. Wizards, clerics and paladins of the Light can draw upon this energy, and use it to power their spells.

However, as mentioned above, this can have dire consequences. Casting spells consume energy from one's surroundings, and an absence of Light is an open invitation for Shadows to emerge. Furthermore, channeling energy from one's surrounding is a difficult and time consuming process - a simple spell like 'magic missile' could take minutes to cast, and fireball could take hours.

Casting Light Magic was outlawed in the continent of Aegar for half a century, until the year 372 EP, when an alchemist discovered the *flora lumino*, a family of flowers capable of collecting and storing Light Magic, more effectively and efficiently than say a human conduit. These flowers proved instrumental in the advancement of magic.

> **GM Notes** <br>
> So what does this mean for you players? For classes that use Light magic (more on that soon), the amount of *flora lumino* you carry on you indicates how many spells you can cast. The quality of the flower will indicate what level spell you can cast with it. Unlike normal DnD, you can use a higher level spell slot at a lower level (not sure why) and the excess Light Magic is released back into the wild.
>
> You might be thinking: if I carry enough flowers, can I cast any number of spells without rest? The answer: technically yes, but the risks are rarely worth it. Spell slots still exist, you can think of them as a spellcaster's mental capacity to cast spells. If you attempt to cast another spell without spell slots remaining, you must roll a number of d12 equal to your level + 1. Your maximum health and current health is reduced by that amount. Should that reduce you to 0, you are instantly killed. Your maximum health will be restored (should you live) upon your next long rest.
>
> Lastly, expended *flora lumino* will recharge during a long rest. 

Light Magic has two forms of channeling: the arcane method, and the divine method. Wizards are those who practice the arcane traditions of studying the Light, weaving it's power to cast mighty spells. Clerics are gifted their spellcasting abilities directly by the Light itself, and paladins owe their divine might to their conviction to their Oaths.

## The Dark Magic of Shadowkind

Dark Magic exists in opposition of the Light. This magic is born from the evils of mortality, from the Sin that plagues the world. Once, this magic was left untouched, believed to be too dangerous to be wielded. After the Exodus, and with the founding of the Slayers' Guild, it became apparent that Dark Magic was a powerful weapon in the ongoing war against Shadowkind.

The most common application of Dark Magic is the usage of Shadow Vestiges - the remains of a purged Shadow. When properly attuned to a Slayer, spellcaster or no, it grants them an ability from the fallen Shadow. 

Shadow Vestiges can also function similarly to the Flora Lumino, as sources of energy for spellcasting. Unlike Flora Lumino, they are consumed/destroyed upon casting the spell. However, casting a spell using a Shadow Vestige does not count towards your allotted spell slots. Furthermore, keep in mind that certain spells cast through a Shadow Vestige will pervert the nature of the spell.

> **GM Notes** <br>
> Now you're thinking, if I carry enough Vestiges, can I cast any number of spells without rest? The answer here is yes BUT you might be underestimating how easy it is to obtain a Vestige. Vestiges are rare, and are extremely expensive. To obtain a Vestige from a Shadow, you must be within 5 feet of the creature as it is killed. If so, you may use your reaction to use your Slayer's Claw to tear the Vestige from the Shadow. The power of the creature will determine the difficulty of the roll.
>
> There are other tools and spells for capturing a Vestige. Some classes will have access to the level 1 spells, Claim Vestige, which functions similarly to the Slayer's Claw but up to 60 feet. Any arrows shot from a Slayer's Bow that defeats a Shadow will allow you to roll to take its Vestige.

There are few spellcasters that channel Dark Magic directly. Warlocks are a primary example, those that are locked in contracts with the Princes of Shadowkind. They neither require Flora or Vestiges to cast their spells, but act as a conduit for their patron.

## Creation Magic and the Bards' College

Long before Light and Dark became the dominant forces of magic into world, the Universe was 'spoken' into existence, at least this is what the Bards' College believes. They preserve the practice of Creation Magic, through music, song and performance.

Unlike the above mentioned forms of magic, creation magic has no object required to draw energy from. Bards can cast magical as they would in most DnD worlds.

## Chaos Magic

Lastly, we have Chaos Magic - a broad category that encompasses any form of power or energy derived from the multiverse, or simply can't be classified elsewhere. There are two primary examples of this you will likely encounter: nature magic, as used by rangers and druids, and sorcery. 

Rangers and druids, similarly to bards, do not require either Flora or Vestiges to cast their spells. Unlike bards, they CAN choose to cast their spells using Vestiges, which will again pervert the nature of their spells.

Sorcerers have an interesting relationship with magic. In every other situation mentioned above, a spellcaster will consume the magic they are casting. In a sorcerers case, every time they cast a spell (that isn't a cantrip), they **create** magic. For a sorcerer, spell slots represent how many spells they can cast before spontaneously combusting.

> **GM Notes** <br>
> When a sorcerer casts a spell when they are out of spell slots, they roll a number of d12 equal to their level + 1. They will take this amount in damage doubled which cannot be reduced by resistance or immunity. The type of damage and the AOE in which it will affect the enemies (and allies) around you is entirely determined by your Sorcerous Origin.

A Sorcerer may also choose to cast a spell using Vestiges which will not count towards their current spell slots.

# Last Notes

Some clarifications:

- These categories of magic do not replace the traditional schools of magic practiced by wizards. Evocation and illusion spells are still referred to as such.
- Traditional material components and/or the need for a spellcasting focus are still required.
- As a general rule, almost every spellcaster can use a Shadow Vestige. The main exception are Clerics in service to the Light (almost all of them, we will get to that soon). Unless it goes against their Oath, Paladins are also free to use Vestiges.
- You can ONLY use a Vestige as a spell slot if you can cast spells of that slot.
