## Prelude

For the last 3 months I've been taking a data science certification course with Brainstation. In a short span of time I've learn to work with numerous technologies in the realm of data analytics and machine learning. This capstone project is the summation of everything I've learned over the last three months, and I am happy to showcase it here.
