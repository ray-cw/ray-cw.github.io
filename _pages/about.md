Hi there, my name is Ray and I am a data scientist. I have my Bachelor's in Computer Science, with experience working in web development, before I decided to make the career change and pivot towards data science. For the last year I've been honing my skills in Python, statistical analyses and machine learning, and I've never felt so purposeful in life. Data science is very much my calling, and thank you for dropping by to see what I've been learning.

**Grimm's Code Monkey** is a fun portfolio site I've thrown together, where I investigate various data sets (some of my own making via web scraping, or obtained via an API) to answer my own questions on a topic. Most of these topics relate to things I am interested in, such as video games, competitive esports, health and nutrition, music, the list goes on and on. If you are interested in the same things as I, or are curious to see the code behind my insights, then take a look through my gallery of little case studies.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or my email.
