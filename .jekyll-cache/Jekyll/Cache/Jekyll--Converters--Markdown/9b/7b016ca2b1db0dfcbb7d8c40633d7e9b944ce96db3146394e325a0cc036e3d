I"ò<p><em>A farmer awakes in the small village of Dawnmill, due east of the capital. He opens his windows and is greeted by a soft, orange glow, not that of the sun,
but of the Light: a massive web of dancing lights that cover all the night skies. The orange aurora indicates the warm season continues. Amidst the orange
are streaks of verdant green, which is a promise of a bountiful harvest. The farmer wastes no time getting to work: what the Light gives, it can just as easily take away.</em></p>
